The ``Gen_funct`` module
------------------------

Part of the pyOMA2 package, this module provides general utility functions crucial for
implementational aspects of Operational Modal Analysis (OMA). These functions support
data preprocessing, mode shape merging, and key calculations such as the Modal Assurance
Criterion (MAC), Modal Scale Factor (MSF), and Modal Complexity Factor (MCF).

Functions:
    - merge_mode_shapes: Merges mode shapes from different setups into a unified mode shape array.
    - MSF: Computes the Modal Scale Factor between two mode shape sets.
    - MCF: Determines the complexity of mode shapes.
    - MAC: Calculates the correlation between two sets of mode shapes.
    - PRE_MultiSetup: Preprocesses data from multiple setups, distinguishing between reference and moving sensors.
    - invperm: Computes the inverse permutation of an array.
    - find_map: Establishes a mapping between two arrays based on sorting order.
