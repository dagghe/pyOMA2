The ``SSI_funct`` module
------------------------

This module provides a collection of utility functions to support the implementation
of Stochastic Subspace Identification (SSI) algorithms. It includes functions for building
Hankel matrices with various methods, converting state-space representations to modal parameters,
performing system identification using SSI, and extracting modal parameters from identified systems.
These functions are integral to performing advanced modal analysis and system identification
in structural engineering and other fields.

The module primarily offers low-level functions that are called by higher-level SSI classes
and algorithms, making it a foundational component of a larger system identification toolkit.

Functions:
    - MAC(phi_X, phi_A) : Computes the Modal Assurance Criterion (MAC) between two sets of mode shapes.
    - BuildHank(Y, Yref, br, fs, method) : Constructs a Hankel matrix from time series data.
    - AC2MP(A, C, dt) : Converts state-space matrices (A, C) to modal parameters.
    - SSI(H, br, ordmax, step) : Performs system identification using the SSI method.
    - SSI_FAST(H, br, ordmax, step) : Efficient implementation of the SSI system identification.
    - SSI_Poles(AA, CC, ordmax, dt, step) : Computes modal parameters from identified state-space models.
    - SSI_MulSet(Y, fs, br, ordmax, methodHank, step, method) : SSI for multiple setup measurements.
    - Lab_stab_SSI(Fn, Sm, Ms, ordmin, ordmax, step, err_fn, err_xi, err_ms, max_xi) : Constructs a Stability Chart for SSI.
    - SSI_MPE(sel_freq, Fn_pol, Sm_pol, Ms_pol, order, Lab, deltaf, rtol) : Extracts modal parameters for selected frequencies.
