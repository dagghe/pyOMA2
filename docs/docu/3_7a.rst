The ``mpl_plotter`` module
------------------------

This module, part of the pyOMA2 package, is dedicated to visualizing and animating mode shapes
from Operational Modal Analysis (OMA) results. It provides an interface to create animated 3D
visualizations of mode shapes, integrating the geometry of the structure and the mode shape data
from OMA analysis. The module leverages matplotlib's animation capabilities to create dynamic
visualizations that can be interactively viewed or saved as GIFs.

Classes:
    :class:`.MplGeoPlotter`: A class to animate mode shapes in 3D. It takes geometry and result objects as inputs
        and provides functionalities to visualize mode shapes with various customizable
        options such as scale factor, view type, and others.

Key Features:
    - Animated 3D visualization of mode shapes based on OMA results.
    - Customizable options for scale factor, view angle, and plot aesthetics.
    - Supports saving the animation as a GIF file.
    - Interactive Tkinter window with embedded matplotlib figure for visualization.

.. Warning::
    The module is designed for use within the pyOMA2 package. It requires OMA results and
    geometry data specific to the structures being analyzed.
