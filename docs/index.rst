This is the new and updated version of **pyOMA** module, a Python module designed for conducting
operational modal analysis. With this update, we've transformed **pyOMA** from a basic collection
of functions into a more sophisticated module that fully leverages the capabilities of Python classes.

The module now supports analysis of both single and multi-setup data measurements, which includes
handling multiple acquisitions with a mix of reference and roving sensors. We've also introduced
interactive plots, allowing users to select desired modes for extraction directly from the plots
generated by the algorithms. Additionally, a new feature enables users to define the geometry of
the structures being tested, facilitating the visualization of mode shapes after modal results are
obtained. The underlying functions of these classes have been rigorously revised, resulting in
significant enhancements and optimizations. Since version 1.0.1, the uncertainty bounds of the
modal properties can also be estimated for the SSI family of algorithms.

We provide four :doc:`examples` to show the modules capabilities:

.. important::

   We have introduced some clustering specialised classes that allow the users to perform Automatic OMA.
   This update enables users to implement and compare a large number of the most popular algorithms
   introduced over the last 15 years, all within the same analysis framework. Furthermore, users have the
   flexibility to mix specific strategies from different algorithms to tailor a specific clustering process
   to their needs.


.. note::

   Please note that the project is still under active development.
