This is the new and updated version of **pyOMA** module, a Python module designed for conducting operational modal analysis. With this update, we've transformed **pyOMA** from a basic collection of functions into a more sophisticated module that fully leverages the capabilities of Python classes.

The module now supports analysis of both single and multi-setup data measurements, which includes handling multiple acquisitions with a mix of reference and roving sensors. We've also introduced interactive plots, allowing users to select desired modes for extraction directly from the plots generated by the algorithms. Additionally, a new feature enables users to define the geometry of the structures being tested, facilitating the visualization of mode shapes after modal results are obtained. The underlying functions of these classes have been rigorously revised, resulting in significant enhancements and optimizations.
